## Local Development

### Prerequisites

```bash
python 3.11+
pip
```

### Installation

```bash
cd railway-pdf-service
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running Locally

```bash
# Start the service
python app.py

# Or using npm script from project root
npm run railway:pdf:dev
```

The service will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

### Testing

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# Test PDF parsing
curl -X POST -F "file=@sample.pdf" http://localhost:5000/parse-screenplay
```

## Railway Deployment

### Using Railway CLI

```bash
railway login
railway up
```

### Environment Variables

Set these in Railway dashboard:
- `PORT`: Automatically set by Railway
- Any additional configuration needed

### Health Check

Railway uses `/health` endpoint for monitoring.

## File Structure

```
railway-pdf-service/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                 # Flask application
â”œâ”€â”€ screenplay_parser.py   # Core PDF parsing logic
â”œâ”€â”€ fdx_converter.py      # FDX to PDF converter
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pattern_enhancer.py    # Enhanced pattern recognition

```

## Development Notes

1. **Pattern Recognition**: Enhanced patterns reduce false positives
2. **Quality Tracking**: Real-time quality metrics for continuous improvement
3. **Hybrid Processing**: FDX files converted to PDF for consistent processing
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with detailed logging
5. **Security**: File validation and cleanup after processing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**: Ensure all dependencies in requirements.txt are installed
2. **Port Conflicts**: Default port 5000, change if needed
3. **File Upload Limits**: Max 50MB file size
4. **Timeout Issues**: 300s timeout for large files

### Logs

Check Railway logs:
```bash
railway logs
```

Local debugging:
```bash
python app.py
# Check console output for detailed logs
```

## Integration with Scriptorly

The service integrates with Scriptorly frontend via:

1. Environment variables in `.env`:
   ```
   VITE_RAILWAY_PDF_ENABLED=true
   VITE_RAILWAY_PDF_SERVICE_URL=https://your-service.railway.app
   ```

2. Frontend automatically routes PDF/FDX files to Railway service
3. Fallback to local parsing if Railway service unavailable
4. Quality metrics displayed in upload interface

## Performance

- Processing time: <30s for 120-page scripts
- Memory usage: Optimized for Railway's limits
- Concurrent requests: Handled by gunicorn workers
- Quality scores: Real-time calculation and reporting
